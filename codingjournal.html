  I have had several entries for the journey today. I am currently on 2070 and VSC i think might be the way to go for me, for now anyway. At least I learned most of my way around VS.</p>

  VISUAL STUDIO 2022 (VS) and VISUAL STUDIO CODE (VSC) operate differently. Please note, when cloning a repository from GitHub to local device (at least on desktop) when using VS the repository will clone the entire folder into the folder you selected to clone to. Meaning that if you selected D: CLONED REPOS/APRILSWEBSITES, then VS will add APRILSWEBSITES to that location, looking like this; D: CLONED REPOS/APRILSWEBSITES/APRILSWEBSITES. Which is a little too janky for me. With VS when cloning a repository to a local device (desktop) VSC will add the folder of the repository to the folder selected, like this; D: CLONED REPOS/APRILSWEBSITES. Hope that makes sense.</p>

  I've already learned quite a bit. 
  <ul>
  <li>The start of most html documents - !DOCTYPE html></li>
    <li>Some of the tags I've learned about and that I also practice with regularly and my knowledge confidence level from 1 to 10 with 10 being highest confidence.'</li>
            <ul>
              <li>html - confidence-7</li>
      <li>head - confidence-3</li>
      <li>meta - confidence-3</li>
      <li>title - confidence-7</li>
      <li>body - confidence-7</li>
      <li>h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 - confidence-7</li>
      <li>p - confidence-6</li>
      <li>a - confidence-2</li>
      <li>div - confidence-2</li>
      <li>article - confidence-1</li>
      <li>section - confidence-1</li>
       <li>main - confidence-1</li>
      <li>span - confidence-3</li>
      <li>ol - confidence-7</li>
      <li>ul - confidence-7</li>
      <li>li - confidence-7</li>
      <li>br - confidence-7</li>
      <li>img - confidence-5</li>
            </ul>
    <li>html tags are code for the start and end of an elements.</li>
    <li>Elements are what is inside the opening and closing of an html tag.</li>
    <li>Self closing tags as they are referred to often in htm are actually void elements. Void elements are tags with no closing tag; for example an img tag or a meta tag. in HTML5 void elements can be written with or without the trailer slash. I will list all the self closing tags here below, when i get to it.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>area</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A good depiction of this found here</p>

<h4>202504050640</h4>
<p>
  I would first like to note the format for entry time "202504050640" broken down is ("0000" year with 4 digits, "0000" month and dqy both is with dual digits and both month and day totaling 4 digits, "0000" the time of day using military time format giving us a code for the time and day = 202504050640. This is how I plan to name things from here on out, including these journal entires as part of a name convention for myself. This portion of this journal is written with VS 2022, logging this journey journalistically in descending order on this page which I will somehow host live someday.
